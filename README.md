# Crowdfunding-ETL
### Module 8 Challenge
#### Overview

In this module we learned the following
* Create an ETL pipeline that moves raw data to a SQL database.
* Extract data from an external file by using Python and Pandas.
* Use regular expressions to extract numbers and text.
* Clean and transform data by using Python and Pandas.
* Design a database and a table schema by using an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
* Load data into a PostgreSQL database.
* Perform data analysis by using SQL queries.

#### Deliverables
Utilizing the skills that were learned throughout the module we will now add a dataset with the backers who have pledged to the live projects. We will have to use this new data in order to create the four deliverables below. 

* Deliverable 1: Extract Data
* Deliverable 2: Transform and Clean Data
* Deliverable 3: Create an ERD and Table Schema, and Load Data
* Deliverable 4: SQL Analysis
